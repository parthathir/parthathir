I
I've built my career in the broad Marketing of technology offerings. I have more than 25+ years of collective experience in big technology companies and start-up companies. Starting with a strong technology background, I progressed in my career to product management, product marketing, and business development. I went on to lead the Marketing organization of 12+ people directly in my past few roles in technology and SaaS offerings bundled with value-added services.
I have led the messaging, positioning, and describing the diverse offerings, performing top-to-bottom competitive analysis, and delivering a unique value proposition on how our products/ solutions can differentiate while adding value to the customers, working with the cross-functional teams. I framed the end-to-end marketing strategy, built and executed the GTM plan, and created marketing collaterals from product conception to launch and post-launch.
My working style, leadership, and experience will be a key asset to the organization.
